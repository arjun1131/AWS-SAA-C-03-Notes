EC2 is a compute service where you can create instances with certain specifications.
There are seven types of EC2 instances 
1. General Purpose
2. Compute optimized
3. Memory Optimized
4. Accelerating Computing
5. Storage Optimized
6. Instance features
7. Measuring instance performance

### Naming Convention :

### General Purpose :(t)
It will be having complete balance on Compute , Networking , Memory.
The use cases are general purpose like computing small tasks

### Compute Optimized : (C)
These instances are used on tasks which requires high performance guaranteed. 
The use cases are Batch processing workloads & Media transcoding

### Memory Optimized : (R)
These instances are used on tasks where we need to process large data sets in memory.
The use cases are relational DBs,non relational DBs and In memory databases optimized for BI
Applications performing real time processing of unstructured data.

### Storage Optimized :
These instances are used on storage intensive tasks that requires high , sequential read and write access to large data.
The use cases are High frequency OLTP systems, Cache for in memory databases & Distributed file systems
