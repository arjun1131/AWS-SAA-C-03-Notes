**Confidentiality** : Limiting access to authorized people, restricting access to unauthorized people.<br>
**Integrity** : It includes consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data.<br>
**Availability** : Readiness of information resources.<br>

## Security Design Principles :<br>

1. Implement a strong identity foundation - Grant access to data and other resources to only the people who really need that access.<br>
2. Enable traceability - Knowing what workloads are deployed and operational allows you to audit and ensure that the environment is operating at the security governance levels expected and demanded by the security standards.<br>
3. Apply Security at all levels - Should apply security protocols in all level (Application, Network, Data)<br>
4. Automate security best practices.<br>
5. Protect data in transit and at rest.<br>
6. Minimize your attack surface.<br>
7. Prepare for security events.<br>
