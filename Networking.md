Networking is how you connect another computer with another set of computers and communicate with them.
Routing is process of selecting a path across one or more networks.

**IPv4 notation :**
The 32 bits are grouped into groups of 8 bits, also called octets. Each of these groups is converted into decimal format separated by a period.
We need this to when we try to communicate.

## Classless Inter-Domain Routing:

CIDR notation specifies an IP address, a slash ('/') character, and a decimal number. The decimal number is the count of consecutive leading 1-bits (from left to right) in the network mask. The number can also be thought of as the width (in bits) of the network prefix. The IP address in CIDR notation is always represented according to the standards for IPv4 or IPv6. 
The number of addresses inside a network or subnet may be calculated as 2^address length âˆ’ prefix length^, where address length is 128 for IPv6 and 32 for IPv4
